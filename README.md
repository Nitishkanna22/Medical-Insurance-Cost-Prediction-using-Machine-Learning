# Medical-Insurance-Cost-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning
Predicts medical insurance costs using factors like age, BMI, and smoking status. Comparing Linear, Polynomial, and Ridge regression, the project found that combining Ridge Regression with polynomial features yielded the highest accuracy (R² ~0.86), effectively capturing non-linear cost relationships.
